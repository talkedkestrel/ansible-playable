Playable is an Ansible Playbook generator UI developed in MEAN stack using [Yeoman angular-fullstack-generator](https://github.com/angular-fullstack/generator-angular-fullstack) and built using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). 
The tool may be used by an individual or a team to 
   - Generate Ansible Playbooks
   - Easily Search and import roles from Galaxy or Github
   - Execute and Test Playbooks (Not available in the publicly hosted version)
   - Develop custom modules and test them
   - All the above while enforcing Ansible Best Practices
  
This is a fun project I started working on from my experience working with Ansible and developing custom modules, hoping that it will help the Ansible community.

> Note: This project is in its initial Alpha release. Hence this is only to be used for test purpose and at your own risk.

## Demo

Try a publicly hosted live demo at [playgenerator.superuserdo.io](http://playgenerator.superuserdo.io/) 

> Note: You may create projects and playbooks. But cannot execute or test them. For this you must host a private version of the tool yourself, following instructions below 

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to use Docker. The latest version of the software is built using docker and is available at [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mmumshad/ansible-playable/)
 
 Run the image to get started
```
  docker run -p 80:8080 mmumshad/ansible-playable
```

Remember to use port mapping to map http port to external host. 

Once the docker container is running visit http://<docker host\> to access the web portal. 

The above command should only be used for testing purpose as the changes you make are not saved. The projects you create are not retained after restarting docker container. 

To persist data across docker container restarts use the below command to map volumes from docker container on the docker host.
```
  docker run -p 80:8080 -v /data/db:/data/db -v /opt/ansible-projects:/opt/ansible-projects mmumshad/ansible-playable
```

This command creates two volume maps - /data and /opt/ansible-projects. These directories must pre-exist on the docker host. All changes made by the docker container will now be stored in these folders.

### Advanced options

Some advanced options on customizing execution are given below

#### External database
By default the web application uses a local mongodb instance. To use an external instance of MongoDB provide a different environmental variable using the -e parameter in docker command
 
 ```
   docker run -p 80:8080 -e MONGODB_URI=mongodb://dbuser:password@test.mlab.com/ansible-playable mmumshad/ansible-playable
 ```

#### S3 storage for projects data
By default all ansible projects and files are stored at location /opt/ansible-projects. You may map volume using docker run parameter -v to map a local volume on host to this directory.
In case you need this to be on an external S3 store, set the below environment variables:

    - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=KEY
    - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=SECRET_KEY
    - MOUNT_S3=True
    - S3_PATH=ansible-playable-storage/data
    
Example Command:
```
   docker run -p 80:8080 -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=KEY -e - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=SECRET_KEY -e MOUNT_S3=True -e S3_PATH=ansible-playable-storage/data mmumshad/ansible-playable
```

#### Authentication

To configure Google Authentication provide the below keys:

    - DOMAIN=http://ansible-playable.com
    - GOOGLE_ID=ID
    - GOOGLE_SECRET=SECRET

> Note: you must first configure google authentication and gather the GOOGLE_ID and GOOGLE_SECRET for this.

#### Admin user account
By default the local admin account is created and the email used is "admin@example.com" and the password is "admin". Provide the below environment variables to use a different password or to recreate admin and test account

    - SEED_DB=true
    - EMAIL_USER_ADMIN=admin@playable.com
    - PASSWORD_ADMIN=ADMIN_PASSWORD
    - EMAIL_USER_TEST=test@playable.com
    - PASSWORD_TEST=TEST_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD

### Prerequisites

#### With Docker

A host with docker installed. For instructions on installing Docker on host please check [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)  

#### Without Docker

Without Docker you will have to setup the system manually:
  
  Install the following dependencies

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js and npm](nodejs.org) Node >= 4.x.x, npm >= 2.x.x
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) (`npm install --global gulp`)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) - Keep a running daemon with `mongod`
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.org/)

  The Dockerfile in this code repository will give you the exact instructions to install dependencies and setup environment

### Developing

1. Run `npm install` to install server dependencies.

2. Run `mongod` in a separate shell to keep an instance of the MongoDB Daemon running

3. Run `gulp serve` to start the development server. It should automatically open the client in your browser when ready.

## Build & development

Run `gulp build` for building and `gulp serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `gulp test` will run the unit tests with karma.

## Limitations

Only compatible with Ansible version - <2.4. 

## Improvements
- Improve Logging
- Improve Testing - add additional test cases
- Improve Security
- Sharing projects with multiple users
- Implement Vault Support
- Integration with Active Directory/LDAP
- Improve Collaboration 
  - Sharing projects between multiple users
  - GIT integration
